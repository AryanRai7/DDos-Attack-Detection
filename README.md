# DDos-Attack-Detection
Programed a tree-based ML model to detect DDoS attacks by combining XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest classifiers. The model uses traffic volume, traffic patterns, and source IP address to identify DDoS attacks.
The model is trained on a dataset of both normal and malicious traffic data. The model is evaluated on a test set and achieves high accuracy. 
The precision and recall curve of my model has 80% accuracy which is better than many pre trained models .
